# SubdiffusionQMC.jl
Numerical examples for the paper *Time-fractional diffusion equations 
with randomness, and numerical estimations of expected values*.

Figures 1 and 2 are generated by the scripts `figures/fig1.jl` and
`figures/fig2.jl`.  Table 1 is generated by `tables/table1.jl`.  Before you
can run these scripts, you must first run `tables/compute_solutions.jl` which
generates data files `soln_N.jld2` for $N=16$, $32$, ..., $512$.  The code is
multithreaded so you should start julia with the `-t` option set to the number
of available cores.  My somewhat dated 8-core CPU (R7 3700X) took about 25
minutes to produce the reference solution saved as `soln_512.jld2`.
